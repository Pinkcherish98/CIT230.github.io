        <h4>New York Times</h4>
        <h4><a href="https://www.Nytimes.com"></a>The New Yotk Times</h5>
        <img src="images/nYT.jpg" alt="NyTimes">
        <p> The logo is big and stands out, contributing effectively to the websiteâ€™s branding. The object nearest to the logo is the horizontal navigation bar below.
         Because the navigation bar is dark, it contrasts with the logo. And plenty space between the two sections.
         This is also a good example for the contrast because the main tow color of this site is black and white.</p>

        <h6>Target</h6>
        <h6><a href="https://www.target.com"></a>Target</h6>

        <p> Target shows sales with different color of font to emphasis and also attach pictures that are related to what they are advertising. 
            Overall, they fit well with the website theme and color together. </p>
